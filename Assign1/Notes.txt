Quantile..?

Simulating possible outcomes of a two sample t-test



*qqnorm on a sample from a normally distributed data set will be a straight line, and deviation from this line indicates non-normal distribution






Specific R Notes:

suppose y = a vector (a list)
init w/ y=5*(1:5)
y = [5,10,15,20,25]

now mean y is clearly 15,
mean(y) >> 15

the following results in a binary, T/F, vector
y>10 >> [1] FALSE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE
further, the mean of that binary list:
mean(y>10) >> 0.6



**rnorm signature:
 - rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
 - n=size
 - mean=mean
 - sd=standard deviation

**t.test signature:
 - t.test(x,y,options)
 - x=non-empty numeric vector
 - y=maybe-empty numeric vector (non-empty = two-sample t-test)
 - options are numerous, here's what we're using:
 	- var.equal=BOOL: "a logical variable indicating whether to treat the two variances as being equal" (from help("t.test"))

**seq() use:
 - seq(x,y,by=inc)
 - generate a sequence of numbers from x to y, in inc increments
 - seq(1,10,by=1): [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
 - seq(1,2,by=0.1): [1.1, 1.2, 1.3, ..., ..2]



Exercise 1 Notes:

* We're generating fake data based on the following:
	- 180 mean (population) height of men
	- 175 mean (pop.) height of women
	- 30: sample size
	- sd: 10
* Generate "samples":
	- x=rnorm(m,mu,sd)
		--> x=rnorm(30,180,10)
	- y=rnorm(n,nu.sd)
		--> as above
* Run 2-sample t-test:
	t.test(x,y,var.equal=TRUE)



Questions on Assignment:
For exercise 1: should we include all the plots, or just indicate which we think were sampled from a normal distribution?
